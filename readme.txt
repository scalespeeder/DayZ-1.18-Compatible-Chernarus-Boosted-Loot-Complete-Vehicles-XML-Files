Using these modded xml files could break the functioning of your DAYZ server, requiring a reinstall that would wipe
all player progress.

Using these modded xml files neccessitates increased regular restarts to prevent server crashing.

It is suggested you thoroughly test your server after applying these files to ensure proper
functioning of your server.

To install these files simply reset your XMLS to default, then upload these over the top of your existing files and restart your server.

These XML files will add a one-off Trader Truck parked outside the shop in Novy Sobor. DONE.

A special "Event" tuck ("VehicleTruckEvent") has also been added. The "event truck" spawns in at the top of the Ski Run in the West,
and the idea behind it is that it is a "spare" truck that you can load up with whatever you like (edit its entry in cfgspawnabletypes),
and it won't appear anywhere else. I wanted a truck that I could fill with weapons, or NVG, or Hesco crates, or barrels, or tents  etc,
that could be used to "create" events elsewhere in the map eg laying out a race track at NWAF, or putting tents down for a Conquest type
PvP event etc - in otherwords a simple way a server owner can easily spawn in a lot of items and them have the ability to drive them somewhere. DONE.

The Trader Truck and Event Truck are one-off spawns. To make them spawn in again, either "ruin" the engines or disable and re-enable the
event. DONE.
